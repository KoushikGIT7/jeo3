# Firebase Integration Complete ✅

## Summary

The cafeteria application has been **fully migrated from localStorage to Firebase Authentication + Firestore** with production-grade real-time capabilities.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Firebase Setup
- ✅ Installed Firebase package (`npm install firebase`)
- ✅ Configured `firebase.ts` with proper initialization
- ✅ Loads credentials from environment variables (with fallback to provided config)
- ✅ Exports `auth` and `db` properly

### 2. Authentication Integration
- ✅ Created `services/auth.ts` with Firebase Authentication
- ✅ Role-based access control (student, cashier, server, admin)
- ✅ Auth state persistence across reloads using `onAuthStateChanged`
- ✅ Guest mode support for students
- ✅ Updated `App.tsx` with auth state management
- ✅ Updated `LoginView.tsx` to use Firebase sign-in

### 3. Firestore Data Migration
- ✅ Created `services/firestore-db.ts` - complete Firestore service
- ✅ Replaced all localStorage operations with Firestore
- ✅ All data collections migrated:
  - `users` - User profiles with roles
  - `orders` - All orders with real-time updates
  - `menu` - Menu items
  - `inventory` - Inventory tracking
  - `settings` - System settings
  - `scanLogs` - QR scan logs
  - `serveLogs` - Serving logs

### 4. Real-Time Data Flow
- ✅ **Cash Order Flow** (REAL-TIME):
  - Student creates cash order → Firestore
  - Cashier portal listens via `onSnapshot` → sees order instantly
  - Cashier approves → `paymentStatus = 'SUCCESS'`, `qrStatus = 'ACTIVE'`
  - Student portal listens → QR appears automatically (NO refresh needed)

- ✅ **QR Generation**: Automatic when payment confirmed
- ✅ **Serving Dashboard**: Real-time updates via `onSnapshot`
- ✅ **Admin Analytics**: Live data from Firestore

### 5. Firestore Transactions
- ✅ `confirmCashPayment` - Uses transaction to prevent double approval
- ✅ `serveItem` - Atomic transaction for serving + inventory update
- ✅ `updateInventory` - Transaction-based inventory decrement
- ✅ Prevents race conditions, duplicate serving, negative inventory

### 6. Security Rules
- ✅ Created comprehensive `firestore.rules`
- ✅ Role-based access control:
  - Students: Can create orders, read own orders
  - Cashiers: Can approve cash payments, read orders
  - Servers: Can serve items, update inventory, read orders
  - Admins: Full access to all collections
- ✅ Write-once logs (scanLogs, serveLogs)
- ✅ Immutable orders after completion

### 7. Updated Views
All views now use Firestore:
- ✅ `PaymentView.tsx` - Uses Firestore for orders
- ✅ `CashierView.tsx` - Real-time pending orders listener
- ✅ `QRView.tsx` - Real-time order listener
- ✅ `HomeView.tsx` - Firestore menu and orders
- ✅ `ServingCounterView.tsx` - Real-time serving dashboard
- ✅ `AdminDashboard.tsx` - Firestore for all admin operations
- ✅ `ScannerView.tsx` - Firestore for QR scanning

## 🔄 Real-Time Flow (No Refresh Required)

```

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Add to `.env.local` and Netlify:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyBRzOIMBTExHkfM92EMNfCodh63t54OKSw
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=joecafe-a7fff.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=joecafe-a7fff
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=joecafe-a7fff.firebasestorage.app
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=1034738714307
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:1034738714307:web:95e1f52bfa57a101ae8476
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-BSF8C3H6S4
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy Firestore Rules:**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

2. **Deploy Firestore Indexes:**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
   ```

3. **Create Initial Users:**
   - Go to Firebase Console → Authentication
   - Create users manually or use Admin SDK
   - Set user roles in Firestore `users/{uid}` collection

4. **Initialize Menu:**
   - Menu will auto-initialize on first load via `initializeMenu()`
   - Or manually add items via Admin Dashboard

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Cart Storage**: Cart still uses localStorage for UX (this is fine - orders are in Firestore)

2. **Guest Mode**: Guest students use sessionStorage for temporary profiles

3. **No Polling**: All real-time updates use `onSnapshot` - no manual refresh needed

4. **Transactions**: Critical operations (serving, cash approval) use Firestore transactions

5. **Security**: All operations are protected by Firestore security rules
