# Firebase Integration Status

## ❌ Firebase is NOT Connected

**Current Status:** Firebase has been **completely removed** from the application.

## Evidence

### 1. Firebase Module (`firebase.ts`)
```typescript
// Firebase has been completely removed from the project.
export const auth = null;
export const db = null;
export const functions = null;
export default null;
```

### 2. All Views Use Mock Database
All components import from `services/db.ts` (localStorage-based), NOT Firebase:

- ✅ `views/Student/HomeView.tsx` → `services/db.ts`
- ✅ `views/Student/PaymentView.tsx` → `services/db.ts`
- ✅ `views/Student/QRView.tsx` → `services/db.ts`
- ✅ `views/Staff/CashierView.tsx` → `services/db.ts`
- ✅ `views/Staff/ServingCounterView.tsx` → `services/db.ts`
- ✅ `views/Admin/Dashboard.tsx` → `services/db.ts`

### 3. No Firebase Dependencies
`package.json` shows **NO Firebase packages** installed:
- ❌ No `firebase` package
- ❌ No `@firebase/*` packages

### 4. Firestore Service Not Used
`services/firestore.ts` exists but is **NOT imported anywhere** in the application.

## Current Data Storage

The application uses **localStorage** for all data:

| Data Type | Storage Location |
|-----------|------------------|
| Orders | `localStorage.getItem('joe_mock_orders')` |
| Settings | `localStorage.getItem('joe_settings')` |
| Scan Logs | `localStorage.getItem('joe_scan_logs')` |
| Serve Logs | `localStorage.getItem('joe_serve_logs')` |
| Cart | `localStorage.getItem('joe_cart')` |
| Student Profile | `localStorage.getItem('joe_student_profile')` |

## What This Means

✅ **App works without Firebase** - Uses localStorage  
❌ **No real-time sync** - Data is browser-specific  
❌ **No cloud backup** - Data stored locally only  
❌ **No multi-device access** - Each browser has separate data  
✅ **No setup required** - Works out of the box  

## To Connect Firebase

If you want to connect Firebase, you need to:

1. **Install Firebase packages:**
   ```bash
   npm install firebase
   ```

2. **Update `firebase.ts`** with actual Firebase config

3. **Replace `services/db.ts`** functions with Firestore calls from `services/firestore.ts`

4. **Add Firebase credentials** as environment variables

5. **Update all views** to use Firestore instead of localStorage

See `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS.md` for detailed setup instructions.

## Summary

**Answer:** No, Firebase is **NOT** connected throughout the application. The app uses **localStorage-based mock database** (`services/db.ts`) for all data operations.
